# cloud-native-demo

A Complete cloud-native application using CNCF tools. 
Starting from a Kubernetes cluster that will serve as our control plane:
- We are creating our infrastructure using Crossplane.
- We are using the "Book Info" application as an example to deploy it on the infrastructure.
- We are using Istio as our service mesh tool.
- Both the infrastructure and the application are synchronized using GitOps ArgoCD."
